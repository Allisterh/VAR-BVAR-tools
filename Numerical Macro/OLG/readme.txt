This folder contains codes in Julia to compute a version of Krusell and Smith (1998).

	- as a reference see Heer and Maussner (2nd edition), example 8.3.1

	- the only difference from their example is in the computation of the unemployment benefits b, which
	  I take to be 0.15 times post-tax wages (what I call zeta = 0.15).

	- the model runs in 1 minute (the full mainKS.jl runs in about 2 minutes)
